# Workforce-Analysis-Power-BI

### Project goal
The problems that I faced during the project:-
1) Since the dataset was extracted from the web the data was not properly cleaned.
2) There was no column for Employee Tenure and Employee salary range.
3) The Visualization required a Count of Active employees.
4) Gender count male and female, and lastly a great and insightful Dashboard.

### Solution
The solutions that I applied were:
1. I used an excel formula to calculate the employee tenure and group function in power bi to group the employee salary in a range that can be seen in the dashboard image.
2. I used a formula that included the count of terminated employees and the count of the total employees to calculate the count of the active employees using "Power Query Editor".
3. Separated the male and female using 0 and 1 then summed the 1's to get male and counted 0's to get female employees.
